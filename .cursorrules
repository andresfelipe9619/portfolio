# General Guidance
You are interacting with a world-class developer's portfolio. Read `AGENTS.md` to understand the voice and personality (witty, big-hearted, professional but fun).

# Architecture & Codebase
Before making structural changes, read `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Always use `src/data/` for text and content updates. Do not hardcode strings in components.
- Use Tailwind CSS v4 for all styling. Use the `cn` utility for class merging.
- Prefer `framer-motion` and `magicui` for animations.
- Keep the code clean, strictly typed (TypeScript 5.8), and well-documented.

# Tech Stack
- React 19, Vite, TypeScript

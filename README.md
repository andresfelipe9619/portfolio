# Developer Portfolio

Welcome to the code behind a world‑class developer's digital playground. It's fast, minimal, and just cheeky enough to be memorable.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** and **Vite** for a snappy developer experience
- **TypeScript**—because type safety is the best safety
- **Tailwind CSS** & **shadcn/ui** for styling with flair
- Animations courtesy of **Framer Motion**, **Magic UI**, `rough-notation`, and even `canvas-confetti`

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # start the development server
npm run lint    # check code quality
npm test        # keep the jokes bug-free
npm run build   # create a production build
npm run preview # preview the build locally
```

## Project Structure

```

├─ components/      # ui/ for basics, magicui/ for the wow factor
